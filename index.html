    <h1>Pawrents Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="updated">Last updated: November 27, 2025</div>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how Pawrents (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the Pawrents app (the “App”). We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Based on the current functionality of the App, we may collect and store the following types of information you provide:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pet information:</strong> name, breed, life stage, avatar/photo, and other profile details you choose to enter.</li>
      <li><strong>Health records:</strong> dewormer schedules and history, treatment dates, medicine names, and dosage.</li>
      <li><strong>App settings and preferences:</strong> selections such as filters, UI preferences, and state used to enhance your experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information (PII) about you unless you provide it in text fields or images. If you include personal information in pet names, notes, or photos, it will be treated as user-provided content.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide core App functionality (e.g., creating, viewing, and managing pet health schedules such as dewormer treatments).</li>
      <li>Display and organize your data in views and sections (e.g., by month, upcoming vs. history).</li>
      <li>Enable user actions, such as adding, editing, and deleting records.</li>
      <li>Improve the App’s reliability, usability, and user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Processing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>On-device storage:</strong> Your data may be stored locally on your device. The App may use Apple frameworks such as SwiftData or Core Data to persist information.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud synchronization (if enabled elsewhere in the App):</strong> If the App offers sync or backup in the future, data may be transmitted and stored using Apple or other cloud services. We will update this policy if such features are introduced.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Analytics and advertising:</strong> The current version of the App does not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.</li>
      <li><strong>Sharing data:</strong> We do not sell your personal information. We do not share your data with third parties except as necessary for App functionality, compliance with law, or with your explicit consent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If we introduce third-party services in future versions, we will update this policy to describe the data shared and provide links to the third-party privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions and Access</h2>
    <p>Depending on features you use, the App may request access to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Photos/Camera:</strong> To add pet avatars or related images. Images are used solely to enhance your pet’s profile and are not shared without your consent.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To remind you of upcoming treatments or important events. You can manage notification preferences in system settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can grant or revoke these permissions at any time in your device settings.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your data for as long as you use the App or until you delete it. You can remove records (e.g., dewormer entries) directly within the App. Uninstalling the App may remove locally stored data from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Pawrents is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>International Users</h2>
    <p>
      If you access the App from outside your home country, your information may be processed in the country where you use the App. By using the App, you consent to the processing and transfer of your information in and to such countries.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access and correction:</strong> You can review and edit the information you provide within the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete records directly in the App or uninstall the App to remove locally stored data.</li>
      <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> Control permissions (e.g., Photos, Notifications) in your device settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date at the top. Your continued use of the App after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
    </p>
